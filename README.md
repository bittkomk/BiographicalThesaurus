New Concept Mapf for stis:Person concept
----------------------------------------
This has to be added with the Sesame Workbench Add function to create gnd:Person and stis:Person.

@prefix stis:    <http://localhost/default#>.
@prefix gnd:     <http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd#>.
@prefix rdf:     <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.

gnd:DifferentiatedPerson
      rdfs:subClassOf gnd:Person .

gnd:UndifferentiatedPerson
      rdfs:subClassOf gnd:Person .

gnd:Person
      rdf:type owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf stis:Person .

stis:Person
      rdf:type owl:Class .



Ideas and future goals for the biographical thesaurus [to be extended!]
-----------------------------------------------------

-derive events from the data
-what influenced a person/writing process (which historic events etc.)?
-link historic maps to the person and the time and the place this person lived... cool idea :-)
-can you outsource the process of linking resources to the user? maybe the user could use a tool to annotate the resources... like the Wikipedia concept
-generate hypothesis from the data ("We assume that there was a person X in MÃ¼nster at time YYYY") and present this to the user... maybe this is interesting for research/scientists of the domain (but: how to represent a hypothesis in RDF, what is a fact etc.)
